= Blowing up pixel art on the Web

:hp-tags: CSS

If we take an image representing pixel art, for instance this 16×32 pixel Mario GIF:

image::pixelart.gif[Mario]

and blow it up (e.g. by setting `width: 160px` on the image in CSS), the browsers’ default scaling algorithm (bilinear interpolation, I think) will **not** preserve the image’s pixels:

image::pixelart.gif[Mario, 160]

In order to retain the pixelated look, in a cross-browser fashion, we need to set these **four CSS declarations** on the image:

[source,css]
----
.u-preserve-pixels {
  
  /* IE */
  -ms-interpolation-mode: nearest-neighbor;
  
  /* Firefox */
  image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges;
  
  /* Safari */
  image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
  
  /* Chrome and Opera */
  image-rendering: pixelated;
  
}
----

The result:

image::pixelart.gif[Mario with preserved pixels,160]

++++++++++++++
<style>
[alt="Mario with preserved pixels"] { 
  -ms-interpolation-mode: nearest-neighbor;
  image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges;
  image-rendering: -o-crisp-edges;
  image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
  image-rendering: pixelated;
}
</style>

=== What does the spec say?

Have you noticed that each browser engine uses a completely different keyword value (`nearest-neighbor`, `crisp-edges`, `optimize-contrast`, and `pixelated`) for this functionality? The link:http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-images-3/#the-image-rendering[CSS Image Values spec] has recently been updated to consolidate this mess by standardizing `image-rendering: pixelated`. (There is also a `crisp-edges` value, but as the example in the spec demonstrates, this value does not necessarily preserve the original look of pixel art.)

=== What about Edge?

As you may have heard, Microsoft’s Edge browser/engine has started removing legacy `-ms-` prefixes and it looks like `-ms-interpolation-mode: nearest-neighbor` has stopped working. I have suggested `image-rendering: pixelated` for Edge on Microsoft’s feedback forum (UserVoice). link:https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/7902426-image-rendering-pixelated[Vote here!]
