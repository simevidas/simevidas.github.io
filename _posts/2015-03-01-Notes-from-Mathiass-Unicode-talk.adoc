= Notes from Mathias’s Unicode talk

:hp-tags: JavaScript, Unicode, strings

Here are my notes:

- The possible code point values range from `U+000000` to `U+10FFFF` (these are hex numbers). Some code points don’t have symbols but are reserved for future use.
- The first plane, BMP, ranges from `U+000` to `U+FFFF` (~65k symbols). All other code points (`U+010000` and up) are called “astral code points”.
- JavaScript’s hexadecimal escape sequence, `\x`, is limited to 2 hex digits, so it cannot be used for code points above `U+00FF`. The Unicode escape sequence, `\u`, allows 4 hex digits, so it can escape any symbol in BMP.

  '\x41' === 'A'
  '\u03B2' === 'β'

- The ECMAScript 6 Unicode code point escape sequence, `\u{}`, allows up to 6 hex digits (inserted between the braces), so it can represent any Unicode code point. For compatibility with existing ES5 engines, `\u` surrogate pairs have to be used instead.

  '\u{1F601}' === '💩'       // ES6
  '\uD83D\uDCA9' === '💩'    // surrogate pairs for ES5 engines
